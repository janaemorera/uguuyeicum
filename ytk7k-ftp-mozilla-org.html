Hi, please put all old waterfox versions on a website for download, some of us want to use the old features and designs from previous versions, and save old versions for archival purposes.

Recently I came across an issue where I couldn't stream EirSport through my laptop's browser. The reason for this is that I had updated MacOS, which in turn updated to Safari 12 - which no longer supports Microsoft Silverlight. It's not specifically a Mac problem, all major browsers have ended support for Silverlight but Eir haven't updated to something current.

Thunderbird updated to 60.2.1 (32-bit) today and now 65% of my extensions say "is incompatible with Thunderbird 60.2.1". :( I use this stuff daily. How do I go back? I saw one post referencing https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/, but which version do I want to download to support my add-ons?
