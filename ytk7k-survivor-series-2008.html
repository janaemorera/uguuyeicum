Survivor Series November 23, 2008 Boston, MA TD BankNorth Garden Theme song: "Spoilin' for a Fight" by AC/DC (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z0RGGsr-Zs) At SummerSlam, John Cena had faced Batista in a match that caused a serious injury to his neck. During the spot where Batista countered Cena's leg drop into a Batista-bomb, Cena suffered a herniated disc. Noticing a diminishing lack of strength in his arms, Cena did what every wrestler is supposed to do and got the issue fixed immed.

That’s right it’s that time of the week again when we look back and discuss Cena’s WWE Championship (World Heavyweight Championship) reigns, this time we’re looking at his fourth reign between November 2008 all the way until February 2009.

The last show I went to was survivor series 2008, so a lot has changed since then. I’m really excited about this, and really want to get the most out of the evening. I’ve always wanted to go to the royal rumble, and this year decided to treat myself, any advice would be greatly appreciated. quick little notice dont get confused about any matches there is a backstory to all of them. Also the next couple of weeks I'll be rebooking a couple of recent wrestlemania's that need fixing and some other ppvs. Match 1 Cm Punk vs William Regal vs Kane vs Kofi Kingston vs Mark Henry vs Evan Bourne vs Finlay vs Mvp vs Shelton Benjamin in a 9 man money in the bank ladder match. winner: Cm Punk. amp#x200B; Match 2 Jack Swagger vs Christian for the Ecw Championship.I "To be the man, you gotta beat the man" - Ric Flair, several times Not sure if this has been done yet but I wanted to know who "the man" currently is. So, for this post, I'm going to treat "the man" as a title that is defended like a championship at every PPV, meaning every non-tag PPV match each "man" had is now for the title of being "the man" - with the exception of Royal Rumbles. The title cannot change hands via illegitimate means (such as DQ or countout) unless otherwise specified. 
I know people are usually used to my Essential Match lists, but this week I took a break from that and started a different challenge/hobby out of boredom and that was to find promos for every PPV match starting from January 2000 until February 2018 - a long difficult task but hey it's finished now and I'm looking forward to hearing peoples favorite ones. looking at you Rock/Austin WM17 My Way Promo and Taker/Michaels WM26 Running up that Hill Promo. Okay lets go: 2000: - Royal Rumble The following events happened on this day in history! 11/23/1981 - Old School - MSG 11/23/81 ( Mr Saito with Captain Lou Albano vs SD Jones ( Rick Martel vs Hans Schroeder ( Pedro Morales vs Magnificent Muraco in IC Title Match #Brand Warfare: A History of RAW vs Smackdown Hello, in anticipation of the upcoming Survivor Series 2017 Pay-per-view, I decided to, using Wikipedia and memory as my main source, research the history of RAW vs Smackdown matches to find out exactly which brand hosts the superior in-ring competitors! The results I had unearthed a few matches I had forgotten about, and involved a lot of time and tab opening to make sure I knew exactly who was on what brand at the times of these matches. Jinder Mahal catapulting from the low card to being the #1 Contender for the WWE title this week seemingly came out of nowhere, and it inspired me to find some of the other weirdest PPV #1 contenders in WWE history. I'm sure at the time a lot of these made more sense and seemed like they were primed for a big push, but going back now it's hard to imagine them being just one match away from being a world champion. King Mabel WHEN : SummerSlam 1995 PPV OPPONENT : WWF Champion With all the talk about Backlash 2018 being a particularly bad PPV (Bryan Alvarez going as far as to say it's one of the worst he has seen WWE wise) I decided to go through every WWE PPV to see what were the most notably bad events in history according to the average Dave Meltzer ratings. I can't say this is the most scientific assessment as doing anything more in-depth would take up far too much time, but my general criteria was. 1) Looking for Pay Per Views that were consistently 
Unforgiven 2008 Unsanctioned Match: Chris Jericho vs Shawn Michaels (26:53) (Shawn Michaels came out at SummerSlam to make an announcement about his career, however, Chris Jericho interrupted him and attempted to punch him but hit Shawn's wife instead. This is the blow off to their feud. Shawn says he wants to punish Y2J for everything he's done so far.) World Tag Team Championship: Cryme Tyme vs Ted DiBiase amp Cody Rhodes (c) (7:13) ECW Championship-Extreme Rules. Hey wrestling fans, it’s that time of the week again where I give Wreddit a retrospective list of matches from a certain superstar (Even though I’m several days late because I’ve been on holidays, but that’s okay). Over the last couple of weeks I made several lists of Essential Career Matches  You can either access them all through this link (https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/wiki/essentialmatches) or here: Wrestler/Years Date :-- :-- 2000 - 2004 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Square. Note that for Royal Rumbles, championship scrambles, and any match where a wrestler is eliminated or entries are staggered, I have only counted the time starting when Triple H entered the match to when he exited the match.

Dark match, time unknown 4 WWF Survivor Series. Was looking at the past PPV scenes, John Cena's return in Survivor Series 2008, CM Punk's 2011 entrance in MITB, then I watched Survivor Series, Royal Rumble and MITB 2015 and they used the typical HD Set from RAW and SD. What happened? Budget.

So, I'm about to get the network and since I don't know that much about wrestling before 2009 or so, I thought it would be fun watching some of the great stories from before that Era. So, what's your favorite or favorites storylines? Mainly from the narrative part, I don't care if the matches aren't that great as long as the story is and the matches The following events happened on this day in history! 11/23/1981 - Old School - MSG 11/23/81 ( Mr Saito with Captain Lou Albano vs SD Jones ( Finish of Mr Saito vs SD Jones ( Rick Martel vs Hans Schroeder ( Finish of Rick Martel.
